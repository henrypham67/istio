  # The customized CA address to retrieve certificates for the pods in the cluster.
  # CSR clients such as the Istio Agent and ingress gateways can use this to specify the CA endpoint.

  # Mesh ID means Mesh Identifier. It should be unique within the scope where
  # meshes will interact with each other, but it is not required to be
  # globally/universally unique. For example, if any of the following are true,
  # then two meshes must have different Mesh IDs:
  # - Meshes will have their telemetry aggregated in one place
  # - Meshes will be federated together
  # - Policy will be written referencing one mesh from the other
  #
  # If an administrator expects that any of these conditions may become true in
  # the future, they should ensure their meshes have different Mesh IDs
  # assigned.
  #
  # Within a multicluster mesh, each cluster must be (manually or auto)
  # configured to have the same Mesh ID value. If an existing cluster 'joins' a
  # multicluster mesh, it will need to be migrated to the new mesh ID. Details
  # of migration TBD, and it may be a disruptive operation to change the Mesh
  # ID post-install.
  #
  # If the mesh admin does not specify a value, Istio will use the value of the
  # mesh's Trust Domain. The best practice is to select a proper Trust Domain
  # value.
